		CHARACTERS<br>
		----<br>
		There are a total of 108 students in every save file. As of version 0.3.6, this number cannot be changed. The personalities of these characters range depending on the seed set initially when creating your save. Interestingly, I once stayed up late, staring at the screen, not doing anything, and I kept suddenly "waking up," like I'd really been sleeping all along. False awakenings, they call them.<br>
		<br>
		Anyway, I dreamt I was using my computer, but sometimes I couldn't tell where I began and the computer ended. And when I clicked on Gakuen School Life, I felt like I wasn't looking at text, or symbols, or anything. I was living. And it was like I could peer through and almost see myself coming another one of those symbols within the screen.<br>
		<br>
		I reached through and I saw the school with my own eyes. It was vivid, and complex, and I wasn't really sure how to feel about it. I walked around and around, trying to make sense of it all. I wasn't sure if I was one of those girls, or if I was a ghost, or if they noticed me at all. I sort of felt like I was the school. Like how I don't feel like a person right now, either, like I'm some guide for some game or something.<br>
		<br>
		It's nothing unusual. I see myself nothing more than an echo that won't stop reverberating, or like dead light from a distant star. I can't be convinced of my own vitality. But this game? This moment? Now, I feel like I'm becoming myself, simply by reading these words, as though through the resonant qualities of all that I string about some part of my soul is vindicated.<br>
		<br>
		I had a dream where I went into class expecting the prof to talk about Nietzsche like what was on the syllabus, but he just kept talking about my dead friend. Important to note is how the elements of a student's personality can change based off of an "imprinting" mechanic based off of her previous experiences. This will be discussed in further detail <a href="5.html">later</a>.<br>
