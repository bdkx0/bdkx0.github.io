		<h1>This Week in Japan: Gakuen School Life</h1>

		<p>This week's post is about a game that's gotten some Western interest after the release of an English fan translation earlier this month. Known simply as "Gakuen School Life" (学園スクールライフ), its crude ASCII graphics and surprising complexity of simulation has had many likening it to a kind of “Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a>” — except, instead of gameplay consisting of the management of dwarves in a dangerous fantasy world, you're instead tasked with the management of a cast of 108 teenagers as they navigate their lives and relationships in an unnamed all-girls school.</p>
		
		<p>Yes, you heard me right. <em>One-hundred and eight.</em> And that's not including the additional twenty or so faculty characters whose lives are as equally elaborated upon.</p>
		
		<p>You’re not actually supposed to manage all of them at once. Heck, you’re technically not even required to manage any of them. You can simply sit back and watch as the game transmits to you, in strikingly precise detail, the events and thoughts happening on a given day between the hours of 0700 and 1800, for as many semesters as you have time for.</p>
		
		<p>Despite how annoying it is for a game to be ceaselessly described only in comparison to another rather than on its own merits, you can’t really blame people too hard for latching onto the whole Japanese Dwarf Fortress thing. How else are you supposed to quickly relay to a bunch of video game obsessives the kind of emergent gameplay where a half-eaten apple left on a desk heightens the stakes of an <a href="">ongoing love triangle between childhood best friends and a transfer student?</a> Maybe we’re at the exact same point in gaming history as when first-person shooters were so new that they were called DOOM clones.</p>
		
		<p>Point is: I hope we see even more games like this.</p>
