		<p>Hi.</p>
		<p>Hello.</p>
		<p>How's it going?</p>
		<p>How are you?</p>
		<p>Good morning.</p>
		<p>Good day to you.</p>
		<p>Sup.</p>
		<p>Greetings.</p>
		<p>Lovely weather today, isn't it?</p>
		<p>Did you study for that test today?</p>
		<p>How are things?</p>
		<p>I'm glad we got to do karaoke together.</p>
		<p>See you after school, okay?</p>
		<p>I need to go, I'm going to be late.</p>
		<p>Sorry, I can't come, I have club activities today.</p>
		<p>I like your hair.</p>
		<p>I can't wait for summer.</p>
		<p>Catch you later!</p>
		<p>Have fun!</p>
		<p>See you.</p>
		<p>Goodbye.</p>
		<p>It was nice talking to you.</p>
		<p>Excuse me, do you know where the music hall is?</p>
		<p>What's up?</p>
		<p>Good morning!</p>
		<p>I'm sorry, I can't.</p>
		<p>Let's meet again next time?</p>
		<p>Are you free after school?</p>
		<p>Do you want to have lunch with me?</p>
		<p>I'm looking to get a part-time job soon.</p>
		<p>Is everything alright?</p>
		<p>Are you okay?</p>
		<p>I haven't been feeling well.</p>
		<p>It's not that I want to be with you or anything like that!</p>
		<p>It's a secret, okay?</p>
		<p>Ah, it's raining.</p>
		<p>Have you filled out those career forms yet?</p>
		<p>I'll be at the library.</p>
		<p>I'm alright. Don't worry about me.</p>
		<p>Stop bothering me. You're annoying.</p>
		<p>What's your deal?</p>
		<p>But we're both girls.</p>
		<p>I'm worried about $student. She hasn't been to school in a week.</p>
		<p>I painted this for you.</p>
		<p>I'm fine, thank you. And you?</p>
		<p>I'll be in the tea room.</p>
		<p>Summer break was good. I enjoyed it.</p>
		<p>We're in the same class again!</p>
		<p>I miss you.</p>
		<p>I hope you're well.</p>
		<p>I'll be here, if you need me.</p>
		<p>I want to be here, forever.</p>
