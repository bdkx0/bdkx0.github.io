		THE SCHOOL<br>
		---- <br>
		While the traits of the girls within the school are variable depending on both the seed associated with the save file and the history logged, the structure of the school itself does not vary.<br>
		<br>
		The simulation view does not extend past the school's gates. Events which take place outside the school must be inferred from within it. The school is the "stage" from which all drama is set.<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes, when I step into the school, I forget that anything exists outside of its bounds. Wouldn't it be a kinder world if this were true? My outstretched hands reach longingly to touch the blue sky, as though, on the other side, there really was something <a href="3.html">better</a>.<br>
