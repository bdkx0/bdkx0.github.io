	<p>Oh! H-hi! I'm Fox. This is the first test page. U-uhm, so basically how this works is that I'm in charge of this first test page, and uh, I'm here to show you around... (Though, there really isn't much to look at...)</p>
	
	<p>A-and if you'd like to see the other test pages, click the images below. Cat is in charge of the 2nd page and Dog is in charge of the 3rd page.</p>
