	<h3>ABOUT</h3>
	<p><b>WELCOME TO BOUNCE CAT'S WORLD, CHUMP.</b> Are you ready to bounce? Well, Bounce Cat doesn't care who's ready. He just bounces. And so will you, pal. Join Bounce Cat as faces the trials and tribulations of being a disembodied head within the bounds of a whopping 800 total pixels in every direction — that's <b>640,000</b> pixels of <b>Pure Bounce</b>, for all you nerds out there. Watch as every bounce transports Bounce Cat to strange and new locales. Feel the satisfying <b>bwomp</b> as you bounce around.</p>
	
	<p>Click to transport him anywhere you want him. He doesn't care. Look at those soulless eyes — is there anything in there other than <b>BOUNCE</b>? Should there be anything in there other than <b>BOUNCE</b>? Bounce Cat's no philosopher, but we here at Bounce Cat Incorporated ain't inclined to say No.</p>
	
	<p>With every bounce is a brand new emotion, and a brand new feeling . . . the feeling of <b>BOUNCE</b> echoed throughout the ages. You're a part of this now, whether you like it or not. Bounce Cat's counting on you to lead us all into a new World of Bounce. So tune in, turn on, and Bounce Out.</p>
