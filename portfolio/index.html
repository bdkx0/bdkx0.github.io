	<h4>[IDH4035] Honors Seminar: Comics, Fandom, Cosplay</h4>
	<a href="idh4030.pdf">The Liminal Experience of Pensacon</a>
	
	<p>This is a paper that attempts to contextualize the feeling of "unreality" I felt watching crowds at Pensacon 2024 within broader cultural contexts. It was written under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Scott, who helped me go from a loose network of connections I made during ideation to a linear, honed-in final draft.</p>
	
	<h4>[IDH1040] Honors Core: Humanities</h4>

	<p>I wrote a song and made an accompanying music video for this class, related to the theme of this class: the intersections between music, selfhood, and society. We were encouraged to fully use the creative leeway we were given for the final projects of our class -- failure at something we tried hard at wouldn't be penalized.</p>
	
	<h4>[IDH4037] Honors Seminar: Non-Place</h4>
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RPx2xKb6tmU?si=ymG923Zeze37UCzk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p>For the final project of this class, we had to pick a topic to discuss <i>non-place</i> in relation to. To do this, I made a video essay showcasing some ways in which different pieces of media themed around alienation relate to non-place. I consider this a decent practice run for a format I want to do more of in the future.</p>
